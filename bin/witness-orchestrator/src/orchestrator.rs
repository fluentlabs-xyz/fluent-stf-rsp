//! Orchestrator: pulls witnesses from the embedded forward driver, dispatches
//! them to the Nitro proxy, and drives L1 batch signing + submission.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! A persistent pool of `EXECUTION_WORKERS` tasks reads from a priority channel
//! pair (`high_rx` / `normal_rx`) via `biased` select, ensuring re-execution
//! after enclave key rotation takes precedence over fresh witnesses.
//!
//! Witnesses are **pulled** by a single feeder task that calls
//! [`Driver::try_take_new_block`] and forwards the result into `normal_tx`.
//! Back-pressure is natural: when workers are saturated, the feeder blocks on
//! `normal_tx.send().await`, which stops calling the driver, which idles.
//! The main select loop is drain-only — no branch performs an awaited send,
//! so the bounded channels cannot deadlock against it.
//!
//! On key rotation, blocks that need re-execution are fetched via
//! [`Driver::get_or_build_witness`] — cold-store hit is verbatim, cold miss
//! falls through to an MDBX-backed rebuild — and pushed onto the high-priority
//! queue independent of the feeder.
